        agronomic traits are important to improve productivity of popcorn. In this
        study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 258 lines
        was evaluated to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for nine agronomic
        traits (plant height, ear height, top height (plant height subtracted ear
        height), top height\/plant height, number of leaves above the top ear, leaf
        area, stalk diameter, number of tassel branches and the length of tassel)

        over 15%. Nine common QTLs located in the same or similar chromosome regions
        were detected across three generations. Five meta-QTLs were identified including
        QTLs in three independent studies. Seven important mQTLs were composed of
        11–26 QTLs for 4–7 traits, respectively. Only 11 mQTLs were commonly identified
        in the same or similar chromosome regions across agronomic traits, popping
        characteristics (popping fold, popping volume and popping rate) and grain
        yield components (ear weight per plant, grain weight per plant, 100-grain
        weight, ear length, kernel number per row, ear diameter, row number per ear
        and kernel ratio) by meta-QTL analysis. In conclusion, we identified a list
        of QTLs, some of which with much higher contributions to agronomic traits
        should be valuable for further study in improving both popping characteristics
        and grain yield components in popcorn."}],"RecordInfo":{"BibRecord":{"BibEntity":{"Identifiers":[{"Type":"doi","Value":"10.1016\/S2095-3119(15)61060-7"}],"Languages":[{"Code":"eng","Text":"English"}],"PhysicalDescription":{"Pagination":{"PageCount":"11","StartPage":"2547"}},"Subjects":[{"SubjectFull":"Crop
