    # or at the beginning of a line). Those terms are meaningfully different
    # from C, and our users frequently search for them. It turns out to be
    # hard to write a single regexp that does this without affecting any
    # other punctuation, so we pull out C++ and C#; replace all punctuation;
    # and then put them back.
